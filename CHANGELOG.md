# Changelog

All notable changes to PaykanLang are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Move semantics with `mov`.** `mov <expr>` transfers ownership of a local
  variable, parameter, or temporary without a retain/release pair. Use of a
  moved variable is a compile error until it is re-assigned, tracked
  flow-sensitively: a `mov` in one `if`/`match` branch does not poison sibling
  branches, paths are merged conservatively after the construct, and moving a
  variable declared outside a loop without re-assigning it before the loop
  repeats is rejected. `mov self` and moving fields or array elements are
  compile errors. See `language_reference/08-memory-model.md`.
- **`==` / `!=` on reference types dispatch to `equals`.** For classes, `Str`,
  and arrays, `a == b` now calls the virtual `equals` method (and `!=` its
  negation). `Str` comparison is therefore **content** equality
  (`"hel" + "lo" == "hello"` is `True`); arrays keep identity comparison via
  the default `equals`; comparing arrays of different element types is a
  compile error. Overriding `equals` in a class changes how `==` behaves for it.

### Fixed

- Double-frees when an object was reached through more than one owning alias:
  using `self` as a value (return/argument/assignment/`mov`), ownership-taking
  uses of `match` bindings, and array-typed class fields. Fixed by a new
  unique-box runtime invariant — every heap object records its single
  reference-count box in its header, and creating an owning reference reuses
  that box instead of creating a second one.
- `push` / `pop` called on arbitrary receivers (call results, nested
  subscripts) no longer hit an internal assertion.
- `mov` soundness holes: moves in loops of loop-external variables (previously
  compiled, then crashed on the second iteration), false "moved" errors in
  sibling branches, and `mov self` (previously accepted) are now handled
  correctly at compile time.
- A `match` over both `bool` literals now counts as exhaustive for
  "always returns" and field-initialisation analysis.
- The imported-module bitcode cache no longer goes stale or lands in the
  wrong place: it now lives in `.paykan_cache/` under the project root (the
  main file's directory) instead of the current working directory, entries
  are keyed by a content hash of the module plus every module it transitively
  imports (and the compiler/ABI version) instead of file timestamps — so
  editing a dependency's class layout or signature recompiles its importers —
  and entries are written atomically; a corrupt or truncated entry is
  regenerated instead of being loaded.
- Declaring `self` as a method parameter is now a clear compile error instead
  of a confusing arity error at the call site.
- Parser diagnostics are now clang-style (caret + source snippet), matching
  semantic errors; a raw newline inside a string or character literal is
  rejected with a targeted message (use `\n`); the unused `&` token was
  removed from the lexer; out-of-range integer literals are reported reliably;
  an unopenable file no longer calls `exit()` from library code.

### Changed

- Runtime object header grew by 8 bytes: every heap object now carries a
  backpointer to its reference-count box (the unique-box invariant above).
- Cached import bitcode is stamped with an ABI version; caches written by a
  compiler with a different (or missing) ABI stamp are recompiled instead of
  loaded.
- Parse errors changed format from yacc-style one-liners to clang-style
  caret-and-snippet diagnostics.

## [0.0.0] - 2026-06-28

First preview release (not yet tagged in git). PaykanLang is a statically-typed, object-oriented
language that compiles to LLVM IR and is **JIT-executed**. This release is a
deliberately small, honest preview; several features are planned for v0.1.

### Added

- Static typing with full semantic analysis and clear, source-located diagnostics.
- Primitive types `int`, `float`, `bool`, `char`, and the built-in `Str` class.
- Single-inheritance classes with vtable-based virtual dispatch, automatic
  construction (`__init__`) and destruction.
- Object equality with consistent identity semantics: `==` and the default
  `Obj.equals()` agree, and classes may override `equals()`.
- Automatic reference counting (ARC) for deterministic object lifetimes; no GC.
- Enum types and `match` expressions with class-hierarchy, array, and
  int/str literal value patterns.
- Heap-allocated, element-typed arrays (`int[]`, `Str[]`, `Point[]`, …) with
  subscript read/write, `.len()`, `.push()`, `.pop()`, and 2D arrays.
- File-based module system with selective and aliased imports, with bitcode
  caching of imported modules.
- Built-in I/O: `open()` / `File` / `Error`, and `println` / `printerrln`.
- LLVM 17 backend with JIT execution via the ORC LLJIT.
- `paykan <file.pkn>` runs a program; `--emit-llvm` dumps IR;
  `--version` / `-v` reports the compiler and LLVM versions.
- `cmake --install` rules (GNUInstallDirs): the `paykan` binary, the runtime
  archive, and `Runtime.h` are staged for packaging.
- Integer divide and modulo by zero trap via a `noreturn` runtime panic.
- The `destroy()` destructor is compiler-generated and final: user classes cannot
  override it, and direct calls are rejected at compile time.
